Modern asynchronous programming: Promise.all()
Instructions
To complete this practice problem, you will need to write a function that makes use of the Promise.all() class method.

Starter code
To start, make sure you've forked and cloned the constellations server, linked below. Follow the instructions in that repository to get the project up and running.

GitHub: Constellations server
bulkDelete()
Method	Path	Response
DELETE	/constellations/:id	An array of objects.
The bulkDelete() method should take an array of IDs, which could be either strings or numbers. Then, an equal number of requests should be made to the URL above, replacing :id with the given ID.

The return value should be an array of objects, where the only key in that object is an id. You will need to construct this object on your own; it is not what is returned from the Constellations server.

const ids = ["KGQIwSq", "32TN5F8"];
bulkDelete(ids).then(console.log);
//> Request is made to http://localhost:5000/constellations/KGQIwSq
//> Request is made to http://localhost:5000/constellations/32TN5F8
//> Return value: [ { id: "KGQIwSq" }, { id: "32TN5F8" }]
